        KEY VALUES:
            tiers: 50, 100, 250, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000
                = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 squares
            NOTE: (for demo purposes, we can use keybinds to represent different donation tier inputs):
        GRID BUILDING:
            develop a grid where A (area) = 2000, L and W are both factors of 2000
            L and W can be 50 and 40 or some other factor pair of 2000 that is distributed across the final resolution along each axis
            (ex. 1600px for W is divided into 50 sections, and 900px for L is divided into 40)
        UNDER THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE SQUARES THAT ARE PAINTED ARE RANDOM
        FOR DONATIONS <$500:
            FINDING PAINTABLE AREAS:
                a "paintable area" meets the following criteria (can be tweaked):
                1. (the donation tier amount / 50) - 1 squares are around a given square (preferably an exact amount,
                    but the square that has an amount of surrounding unpainted squares that are closest to that amount will be painted)
            PAINTING A PAINTABLE AREA:
                to paint a paintable area:
                one square plus x random squares around the given square produce a shape
            EXAMPLE: $200 DONATION
                IDEAL PERIMETER SQUARES (IP): 3
                IDEAL UNPAINTABLE SQUARES (IN): 5
                [A]       [B]      [C]              KEY:
                U X O  |  X X X  | O O X            U = unpaintable (already painted)
                U C X  |  U C U  | X C O            X = paintable, selected
                X U O  |  U U U  | O X O            O = paintable, not selected
                ------------------------            C = center square
                U = 3     U = 5    U = 0
                X = 3     X = 3    X = 3
                O = 2     O = 0    O = 4
                ------------------------
                best square cluster -> if IP = X and IN = U
                $200 / $50 = 4 squares being the area of the paintable area, 3 squares surround the center square (C)
                From highest to least priority:
                B is highest priority (the amount of paintable squares around a center square are equal to the amount of squares to surround the center)
                A is second priority ()
        FOR DONATIONS $500+:
            = 10, 20, 50, 100 squares
            FINDING PAINTABLE AREAS:
                an IDEAL PAINTABLE AREA is a chain of multiple unpainted squares where the area of the unpainted squares >= the according amount of squares
                * if no chain is possible, create multiple splotches using the same color and use a fading animation
                  on the brush strokes when completed to reveal the image
