# Let's start coding!

Inside the `scripts` folder create a new file named `main.js`. This is going to be where we write all of our code.

Then inside our รง find the line that says:

```html
<script type="module" src="scripts/final.js"></script>
```

and change it to:

```html
<script type="module" src="scripts/main.js"></script>
```

Now we are loading our new blank file instead of our final file.

Inside `main.js` file put:

```javascript
console.log("Does this work");
```

In your web browser [open the web inspector](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/open/) and click the "Console" tab. Then reload the web page. You should see the message "Does this work" without quotes in the console. The webpage should be totally black.

The console tab is crutial. This tab is where we can see any errors in our code. Errors are a natural part of coding. Even the best developers in the world use errors as a way to figure out what is next to do.

## Review

What we did was created a blank Javascript file named `main.js`. We then connected this new file to our [index.html](../src/index.html) file. Inside the Javascript file we put a line of code that showed us a message in the console. The console is a place we can use to "[debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debugging)" our code.

### What is console.log?

When you are writing Javascript code you will use the code `console.log()` very frequently. What this code does is it shows us stuff inside of the console tab in our web browser. Debugging is a term for seeing what's going on inside of the code. Debugging code is purely for us the developer to see how code is running. **It does not do anything in our end result.**

The reason we added `console.log("Does this work");` inside of our `main.js` file was to check if our `main.js` file was being loaded correctly. If it was not loaded correctly we would not see the message in our console.

### Breaking things

Go ahead and change:

```html
<script type="module" src="scripts/final.js"></script>
```

to be:

```html
<script type="module" src="scripts/yolo.js"></script>
```

Now reload the browser and look in the console. Do you see `Does this work`? The reason you don't see this anymore is because we are telling our HTML to load a file that does not exist.

Undo what we did and make sure your [index.html](../src/index.html) file says:

```html
<script type="module" src="scripts/final.js"></script>
```

# Next Step

Now that we know our `main.js` file is hooked up we can move on to the [next step](step3.md)!
