# Prerequisites

Before diving into the development of our Phaser game, there are a few prerequisites that will ensure you have a smooth learning experience. This section will cover the skills you should be familiar with and the steps to set up your development environment properly.

## Skills

To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have:

- **Basic Understanding of JavaScript:** Comfort with JavaScript syntax and fundamentals, such as variables, functions, loops, and event handling, is essential. You don't need to be an expert, but being able to read and write JavaScript will allow you to follow along more easily.
- **Familiarity with Phaser Concepts:** While not strictly necessary, having a basic understanding of what Phaser is and some of its key concepts (such as scenes, sprites, and the game loop) can be helpful. If you're new to Phaser, don't worry â€“ we'll cover the essentials as we go along.

## Setup

Setting up your development environment for Phaser is straightforward. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Check for Node.js:** Before installing Node.js, let's check if you already have it installed and identify the installed version. Open a terminal or command prompt and type the following command:

   ```bash
   node -v

This command will display the version of Node.js currently installed on your system. If you see a version number, Node.js is installed, and you can proceed to the next step. If not, follow the sub-step below to install Node.js.

1. **Install Node.js: (skip if installed)** Phaser projects can be developed without Node.js, but having it will make managing your development server and dependencies much easier. Download and install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

2. **Choose an IDE:** While you can write Phaser code in any text editor, using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Visual Studio Code (VS Code) can enhance your coding experience with features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion. Download VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Set Up a Phaser Project:** Create a new directory for your project, and then open a terminal or command prompt window in that directory. Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init -y`. This step creates a `package.json` file in your project directory.

4. **Install Phaser:** With your Node.js project initialized, install Phaser by running `npm install phaser`. This command adds Phaser as a dependency in your `package.json` file and downloads the Phaser library to your `node_modules` directory.

5. **Start Coding:** Create a new file (e.g., `index.html`) in your project directory to serve as the entry point for your game. You can also create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `game.js`) to hold your game's code.

6. **Run a Local Development Server:** Although you can open your `index.html` file directly in a browser, running a local development server is recommended for a better development experience. If you have Node.js installed, you can use `http-server`, a simple, zero-configuration command-line HTTP server. Install it globally by running `npm install -g http-server`. Then, navigate to your project directory in a terminal or command prompt and run `http-server` to start the server. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to see your game.

With these steps, your development environment is set up, and you're ready to start building your Phaser game!
