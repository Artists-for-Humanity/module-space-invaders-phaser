# Building our first Scene in Phaser

A scene is a gamestate that the user is operating within, this essentially means that everything the player will see within the game will at some point appear in this space. To keep things simple, in this tutorial we will be using one scene for our entire game. More information on scenes can be found [here](https://workshops.nuevofoundation.org/phaser-space-invaders-game/phaser-fundementals/).

## Select a Theme

Before we start adding things into the scene we need to pick a theme for our 'invaders' game. The traditional game has a space theme, hence the name 'space invaders'
